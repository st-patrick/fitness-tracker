Goal longterm: < 95kg > 80kg body fat <= 17% CHECK YAY 😀🎉
Indulge
Just observe. Measure. “Get to know your body”. Then with lots of data, execute
Goal midterm: 38kg muscle mass
Goal once: <12% and 87kg

Bounce back down beyond 95kg and 17%
Bounce back up either under 87 or under 12%


What works for me?
Start eating late
Hella caffeine
Baking and raw ingredients
Taking walks
Doing what’s fun at gym
Plenty rest

Insights:
+ of course I’m tired af when I gain 300g body mass per day. I literally gained almost 3kg in 10 days and 800g in 3 days. That’s like puberty times 10 or so. Also, the fatty intake might cause too much work for me
+ I should be able to gain 500g of non-fat in a month
+ I am getting stronger in the exercises I do but I’m afraid it shifts. Away from gluteals and lats towards my back and abs
+ to be fair, I was in a caloric deficit since I came here and only started whatever I want about 3 weeks ago.
+ in three days, I did convert pretty much all the protein I had into muscle (around 200-300g). I slept plenty >=10ths and did the classics (bench press, squats, deadlifts)
+ general consensus for bulk is just gain any amount and the cut ratio should be 1:0 so at the end not lose any muscle
+ all this body mass building and destroying definitely gets me to bed at 10
+ create a positivity bias. Don’t take any notes unless it’s going exactly right in the last few days
+ boxing does feel good and might help w testosterone
+ percentage measured may also heavily depend on body sweat and nervous system. I thought I gained quite a lot. In the morning I already had 150mg of caffeine. So little sweat? But then again, even after workouts the numbers rarely change
+ it might actually be a good thing that the lying down leg press is harder bc from sitting hamstrings tend to be overstretched and now they are les stretched


Ideas:
+ what about not working out at all in the cut phase? I do always lose fat but with no activity there’s no reason to lose muscle
+ try again with the eat whatever you want style. No tracking. I can estimate afterwards.
+ feed what you want to be consumed: so hardly protein, mostly fat

Muscle percentage gain theories for me:
+ Rest!
+ calories seem to make 0 difference
+ there is too much working out but hardly too little
+ eating and drinking whatever whenever definitely helps retain muscle mass (but also gain more in like a ratio of 3:1 fat:muscle)
+ I lose fat quickly but in a 2:1 ratio
>> let’s say I gains 30kg fat and 10kg muscle. Then I’d lose 30kg fat and 15kg muscle. Hmm…. That doesn’t work out. So I need to lower gain ratio or increase cut ratio or both. Maybe more protein in gain and less protein in cut? Let’s see what happens. Just keep doing it fun and measure


After week of intense sleep rest cardio had largest drop probably. Then again for the first time I did it after a lot of other exercises

Hanging like a monkey

That explains why my nose would look different sometimes. From the nose breathing. It contracts my nose.

Pectoral butterfly machine: no interest in strength, 10 reps for the stretch
20220506 10
20220512 12.5
20220521 15
20220611 12.5
20220616 15
20220627 10 but 3x12-15 reps
20220707 12.5 taking it easy
20220709 15

Chest Press only full range reps no interest in bulging
20220601 30
20220701 32.5

Rhomboid isolation !hold at straight posture!

Reverse fly machine 20 - 10 - (5/10) hold at posture - (7.5/17.5)
20220521 (10/22.5)
20220525 (10/20) might be because posture encourages weakening rhomboids? Been working a lot sitting. Maybe do more reps in between instead to get them used to it
20220602 (12.5/22.5)

Reverse butterfly bench
12 - 8 - (12/20) - (8/??)
20220514 (12/24) max was barely there though and I don’t think my back was at 45deg

Face pulleys for rhomboids 10 - 12.5 - 15
-(10/12.5) - (12.5/15) but seemed to compensate a lot - (2.5/7.5) waaaay too much last/lower back
20220708 (15/20)

Lying face down reverse 🦋: (5/8)

Lats !emphasize stretch rather than last inch of full flexion! But still want it for back mass

Low Row
75 - 45 - (20/40) - (35/70) - extreme focus on stretch breath in out skipped lots of low weights (50/65) - (20/40) but mostly cause forearm weakest point
20220504 (50/85)
20220506 (42.5/45) taking it slow cause BP too low
20220512 (52.5/72.5) didn’t count higher max cause could hardly move to 50%
20220513 (55/77.5) with gloves
20220517 (57.5/80) max with momentum but good range

Lat prayer: 15

Bent over dumbbell rows: 16

Chin up pull up or whatever
20220611 () nope too hard

Psoas
Hanging leg/knee raise: 9 with knee ish far from full range
Roman chair leg knee raises: 9 w knee full ish

Lying on a bench doing two-kettlebell chest press and plates to relax with weighted chest AWESOME
20220716 (30/30)

Bench press
20220801 (15/15) nice feels good
20220804 (15/15) fun
20220807 (20/20)  heavier weights feel easier. Feels good being pressed into bench

Bent over thing just for the stretch:
20220513 35
20220514 35
20220525 40

Bent over thing just a lil bit
20220525 (5/10)
20220603 (5/5)
20220611 (0/0) I could do more but this feels right just reps to avoid it stifling
20220620 (5/5)
20220625 (0/0)
20220701 (10/10)
20220705 (15/15)
20220716 (10/10) but weight on my head so I think it was actually harder
20220725 (10/10)
20220801 (5/5) taking it easy, more like a warmup

Lat Pullover with Hip Bridge
20220614 (10/10)

Renegade row 3x8-10
20220614 (4/4)

Landmine row with dead stops ratio 2:1 3-4x8-10
20220620 (15/15)
20220628 (20/20)
20220709 (25/25)

20220704 (20/24)

X men (my own invention or wha’eva)
20220709 (10/20)

20220709 (10/15)

Close grip pulldown
Bent over barbell/dumbbell row (underhand/overhand)
20220715 (16/20)

Pull Down big ass Machine
20220514 (60/110) probabile cause it’s been a while since done mainly lat exercise
20220517 (62.5/112.5) but max was tough and should relax on stretch more or just put in 2 intermediate weights before max
20220523 (70/70)
20220525 (72.5/107.5) but max with good range
20220601 (75/110) max was ok but should be better
20220611 (80/120) lower rep end hurt and higher end barely got it down and couldn’t release. So maybe next time do nice form again
20220716 (82.5/100) taking it easy
20220804 (85/85) nice and good
20220807 (87.5/87.5) doable.

!ab machine uses all the wrong angles! I need full range. Better use bed or bench or ball thingy.

Sitting ball abs let’s take it easier on the peak weight
(5/10) - (0/1) - (1/8)
20220504 (1/12)
20220505 (4/13)
20220509 (6/14)
20220510 (7/15)
20220512 (8/16) max very carefully rather ATMs bend than lose grip
20220513 (9/17) also careful rather bent but overall worked
20220514 (10/18) careful first lift bent arms then ok
20220516 (11/20) more or less but def not horrible form. After rest day. Also it’s good to compensate as long as you’re not in pain and using functional muscles
20220517 (12/20.5) like the 21 was ok with angled arms. 20 was 1 rep pretty much stretched arms
20220520 (4/12) because chest Prellung or something there
20220521 (0/0) injury
20220523 (4/4) injury
20220524 (6/8) injury
20220525 (8/8) injury
20220527 (10/12) injury still a bit
20220602 (6/6) under-use! after injury
20220603 (8/9) injury under use
20220605 (9/10) injury comeback
20220608 (12/12) hardly still there. After rest. Arms gave out first
20220610 (13/13) mas o menos but no bad pain
20220614 (6/6) taking it easy I think I had too little veggies recently.
20220616 (4/4) take it easy and low on sleep
20220620 (10/10)
20220627 (12/12)
20220628 (8/8) purposely less for recovery
20220701 (12/12) purposely less for recovery
20220707 (13/13)

Abdominal crunch machine
40 - 35 - 35 - (35/40) - (25/40) - (30/35) - holding at full extension and at full flexion in full range (32.5/40)
20220504 (37.5/47.5) possible to exceed 40 threshold cause trained full range on ball before
20220506 (30/35) horrible taurine low BP day
20220509 (40/50) after weekend break
20220512 (42.5/50) directly after sitting ball and might have needed a break
20220514 (45/52.5) 👍
20220516 (47.5/55) but much smaller range on both reps and max. Might want to “feed” it from the bottom a little. Then again, if I do multiple ab exercise a session with overlapping ranges it’s ok to have that overlaying range getting neglected in one of the exercises
20220520 (50/50) cause I don’t know if chest pain from abs so rather go easy. Also lower value wasn’t full range towards later reps
20220616 (45/45) awesome to only lose 5kg after 4 weeks
20220620 (50/50)  Switched to 3x8-10 reps. Not full full range but still did it
20220701 (50/52.5) hard but made it
20220709 (52.5/55) nice
20220715 (55/57.5)
20220718 (57.5/60) taking it easy but still good
20220721 (40/60) taking it super easy quick workout
20220725 (60/65) we made it joe!
20220801 (62.5/67.5) but 67 hardly any range
20220807 (50/65/65) hardly any range. But doing 10x50 at full range is v easy now

Russian twists
20220525 (12/12) injury

Side pulls (the side ab bendy) same here should find a way where peak weight is in upright position for posture muscles and stabilization.
14 - (8/12) - (6/18) (14/20) - (12/28) -
20220505 (14/30)
20220510 (15/32)
20220705 (16/16) takin it easy cause no sleep

Three-Way Windmill (mens health. Weight above head. Kneel one sided and elbow to ground. Kneel both knees and elbow to ground. Switch sides)
20220531 (6/12) feelin it
20220602 (8/14) good stuff
20220603 (9/16) max was hard 1 rep
20220608 (10/18) dope after rest days
20220611 (11/20) fun
20220620 (12/22)
20220625 (13/24)
20220715 (14/14) not feeling like more
20220718 (15/15) hamstring hurt after :(

Glut leg press thing needs to wait until late now cause lack of weights
160kg - (120/240) - (160/260)
20220505 (180/280)
20220509 (200/300)
20220512 (220/335) feels like I could have used a lower warmup than 120. Definitely felt the burn in quads after reps. Slightly. Helped with arms in edge range. Left hamstring acting up. Weirdly not acting up on higher weights.
20220518 (240/345)
20220628 (240/240) just to take it easy
20220708 (280/280) low on sleep and on high end only 6-8 reps
20220718 (80/80) that hamstring worse than usual. From standing/sitting?

Abductor machine (lateral)
20220510 (25/77.5) with minimal range but still. I can lift it.
20220512 (30/77.5)
20220514 (32.5/77.5)
20220517 (35/77.5) still lifted max but seemed harder than usual and barely 50% range
20220520 (37.5/77.5) max barely far. Either cause I did glute 345 or cause I don’t stretch butt and lower my range
20220523 (40/67.5)
20220527 (45/77.5) range 40% but ok I could lift it
20220605 (47.5/77.5) max lift off but more like 25% range I think most strength came from big machine exercises

Adductor machine (central) reps only cause I don’t really want bulgy growth here especially not wo full range
20220510 (20)
20220512 (22.5)
20220514 (25)
20220517 (27.5)
20220520 (30)
20220523 (32.5)
20220527 (35)
20220605 (37.5)

3 point hip rotation for smaller butt muscles. Better system for weights than using shoelaces? Ankle weighs bands. Resistance band! But those idk which one is how strong. Some have labels.
20220514 (1/8)
20220611 (5/7)

Calf
20220521 (20/20)
20220524 (30/90)

Split squats w raised arms n weights like warrior 3x 6-8
20220614 (8/8)
20220705 (12/12) taking it easy no sleep

Leg press the other one
Fewer reps the higher, e.g. 6-8 when 100, 4-6 when 150
20220709 150

Standing leg curl
20220718 (0/0) painful on the left lower tendons
20220720 (0/0) left leg can’t even do 0 with machine must do free form
20220725 (0/0)
20220801 (0/0) still hurts. Like tendons are made of wood splintering. Dry.
20220807 (0/0) but no pain at 135deg angle

Barbell back squat 3x 6-8
20220614 (60/60)
20220620 (60/60)
20220801 (70/70) it was 10x40 8x60 6x70
20220808 (75/75) confidently made it

Prone leg curl
20220807 (5/10) now only pain in non-heated right leg. No problem but 10kg at higher range start hurting
